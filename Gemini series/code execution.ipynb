      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **`is_prime(num)` function:**\n",
      "   - Takes an integer `num` as input.\n",
      "   - Handles cases for `num <= 1` (not prime) and `num == 2` (prime).\n",
      "   - For other numbers, it iterates from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If any of these numbers divide `num` evenly, then `num` is not prime, and the function returns `False`.\n",
      "   - If the loop completes without finding any divisors, then `num` is prime, and the function returns `True`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Main part of the code:**\n",
      "   - Sets `number = 10`.\n",
      "   - Calls the `is_prime()` function to check if `number` is prime.\n",
      "   - Prints the result based on the return value of `is_prime()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Output:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "10 is not a prime number\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why the square root?**\n",
      "\n",
      "We only need to check divisors up to the square root of `num` because if `num` has a divisor larger than its square root, it must also have a corresponding divisor smaller than its square root. \n",

    "## Code execution versus function calling\n",
    "Code execution and function calling are similar features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code execution lets the model run code in the API backend in a fixed, isolated environment.\n",
    "- Function calling lets you run the functions that the model requests, in whatever environment you want.\n",
    "In general you should prefer to use code execution if it can handle your use case. Code execution is simpler to use (you just enable it) and resolves in a single GenerateContent request (thus incurring a single charge). Function calling takes an additional GenerateContent request to send back the output from each function call (thus incurring multiple charges).\n",
    "\n",
    "- For most cases, you should use function calling if you have your own functions that you want to run locally, and you should use code execution if you'd like the API to write and run Python code for you and return the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Billing\n",
    "- There's no additional charge for enabling code execution from the Gemini API. You'll be billed at the current rate of input and output tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here are a few other things to know about billing for code execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "You're only billed once for the input tokens you pass to the model, and you're billed for the final output tokens returned to you by the model.\n",
    "Tokens representing generated code are counted as output tokens.\n",
    "Code execution results are also counted as output tokens.\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "- The model can only generate and execute code. It can't return other artifacts like media files.\n",
    "- The feature doesn't support file I/O or use cases that involve non-text output (for example, data plots or a CSV file upload).\n",
    "- Code execution can run for a maximum of 30 seconds before timing out.\n",
    "- In some cases, enabling code execution can lead to regressions in other areas of model output (for example, writing a story).\n",
    "- There is some variation in the ability of the different models to use code execution successfully. Gemini 1.5 Pro is the best performing model, based on our testing."
