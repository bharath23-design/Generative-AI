    "\n",
    "- Gemini represents each second of audio as 25 tokens; for example, one minute of audio is represented as 1,500 tokens.\n",
    "- Gemini can only infer responses to English-language speech.\n",
    "- Gemini can \"understand\" non-speech components, such as birdsong or sirens.\n",
    "- The maximum supported length of audio data in a single prompt is 9.5 hours. Gemini doesn't limit the number of audio files in a single prompt; - however, the total combined length of all audio files in a single prompt cannot exceed 9.5 hours.\n",
    "- Gemini downsamples audio files to a 16 Kbps data resolution.\n",
    "- If the audio source contains multiple channels, Gemini combines those channels down to a single channel."
